We welcome contributions to THRAG! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- AWS CDK installed globally
- Docker (for local testing)

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/thrag-threat-hunting.git
cd thrag-threat-hunting
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Build the project**
```bash
npm run build
```

4. **Run tests**
```bash
npm test
```

## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing code formatting and naming conventions
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commit format:
```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Test additions or modifications
- `chore`: Build process or auxiliary tool changes

Examples:
```
feat(agents): add new forensics investigation capabilities
fix(rag): resolve knowledge base retrieval timeout issue
docs(readme): update deployment instructions
```

### Branch Naming

- `feature/description` - New features
- `bugfix/description` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/description` - Critical fixes
- `docs/description` - Documentation updates

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- --testPathPattern=threat-hunter
```

### Writing Tests

- Write unit tests for all new functions and classes
- Use descriptive test names
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Mock external dependencies

Example test structure:
```typescript
describe('ThreatHunter', () => {
  describe('generateHuntQueries', () => {
    it('should generate valid hunt queries for given hypothesis', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });

    it('should handle empty hypothesis gracefully', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });
});
```
