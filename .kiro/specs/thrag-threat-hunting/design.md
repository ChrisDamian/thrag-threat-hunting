# THRAG Design Document

## Overview

THRAG (Threat Hunting Retrieval Augmented Generation) is a cloud-native AI-powered cybersecurity platform that combines retrieval augmented generation with advanced machine learning to transform raw security telemetry into actionable threat intelligence. The system leverages Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases for RAG capabilities, Amazon Bedrock AgentCore for multi-agent orchestration, and Claude-3.5 Sonnet for sophisticated reasoning about security threats.

The platform operates through a multi-layered architecture that ingests threat intelligence from various sources, processes real-time security events, and provides autonomous threat hunting, incident response, and predictive security capabilities.
