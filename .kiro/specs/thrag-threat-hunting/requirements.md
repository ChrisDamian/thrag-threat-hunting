# Requirements Document

## Introduction

THRAG (Threat Hunting Retrieval Augmented Generation) is an AI-powered cybersecurity platform that revolutionizes threat hunting by combining retrieval augmented generation with advanced machine learning. The system transforms raw security telemetry into actionable threat intelligence through intelligent knowledge synthesis, autonomous threat hunting, and context-aware response generation. THRAG leverages Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases for RAG capabilities, combining structured threat intelligence with Claude-3.5 Sonnet's reasoning abilities to provide explainable security decisions with source attribution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want an AI-powered threat hunting system that can automatically correlate security events with threat intelligence, so that I can identify sophisticated threats that would otherwise go undetected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a security event is detected THEN the system SHALL retrieve relevant threat intelligence from knowledge bases within 2 seconds
2. WHEN correlating events THEN the system SHALL combine real-time security data with historical attack patterns, threat actor TTPs, and vulnerability databases
3. WHEN generating threat assessments THEN the system SHALL provide confidence scores and citations from authoritative sources
4. IF multiple security events occur simultaneously THEN the system SHALL correlate them using multi-step reasoning to identify potential attack campaigns

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security operations center manager, I want autonomous threat hunting capabilities that can generate sophisticated hunt queries based on emerging threat intelligence, so that my team can proactively identify threats before they cause damage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new threat intelligence is ingested THEN the system SHALL automatically generate hunt queries within 5 minutes
2. WHEN executing hunt queries THEN the system SHALL search across multiple data sources including logs, network traffic, and endpoint data
3. WHEN hunt queries return results THEN the system SHALL correlate findings using retrieved threat actor behaviors and TTPs
4. IF hunt queries identify potential threats THEN the system SHALL generate detailed investigation playbooks with step-by-step procedures

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an incident response team lead, I want context-aware response generation that creates detailed incident response playbooks by retrieving best practices and adapting them to specific threats, so that my team can respond effectively to any security incident.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a security incident is confirmed THEN the system SHALL generate a custom response playbook within 3 minutes
2. WHEN creating playbooks THEN the system SHALL retrieve and adapt proven incident response procedures from the knowledge base
3. WHEN generating response steps THEN the system SHALL include specific containment, eradication, and recovery procedures tailored to the threat type
4. IF the incident involves multiple attack vectors THEN the system SHALL coordinate response actions across different security domains

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a threat intelligence analyst, I want intelligent knowledge synthesis that combines multiple threat intelligence sources with real-time security data, so that I can understand the full context of potential threats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing threats THEN the system SHALL retrieve information from MITRE ATT&CK, CVE databases, NIST frameworks, and threat actor profiles
2. WHEN synthesizing knowledge THEN the system SHALL combine structured threat intelligence with unstructured security reports and breach analyses
3. WHEN presenting analysis THEN the system SHALL provide source attribution with confidence levels for each piece of information
4. IF conflicting information exists THEN the system SHALL highlight discrepancies and provide reasoning for preferred sources

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security architect, I want predictive threat modeling capabilities that leverage retrieved threat intelligence to forecast attack vectors and generate preventive measures, so that I can strengthen our security posture proactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing current security posture THEN the system SHALL predict potential attack vectors based on historical threat data
2. WHEN generating predictions THEN the system SHALL use time-series forecasting augmented with retrieved historical attack data
3. WHEN recommending preventive measures THEN the system SHALL provide specific configuration changes and security controls
4. IF new vulnerabilities are discovered THEN the system SHALL automatically assess organizational risk and recommend mitigation strategies

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want explainable security decisions with detailed reasoning and citations from threat intelligence sources, so that I can demonstrate due diligence and regulatory compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system makes security decisions THEN it SHALL provide detailed reasoning with step-by-step logic
2. WHEN citing sources THEN the system SHALL include specific references to threat intelligence documents, frameworks, and databases
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL create audit trails linking decisions to authoritative security sources
4. IF regulatory requirements change THEN the system SHALL automatically update compliance mappings and recommendations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want a scalable cloud-native architecture that can process high-volume security data in real-time while maintaining sub-second response times for threat analysis, so that the system can handle enterprise-scale security operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing security events THEN the system SHALL handle at least 10,000 events per second with sub-second latency
2. WHEN scaling resources THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust compute capacity based on workload demands
3. WHEN storing threat intelligence THEN the system SHALL maintain vector embeddings for sub-second semantic search
4. IF system components fail THEN the system SHALL maintain high availability with automatic failover and recovery

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a security team member, I want multi-agent orchestration with specialized RAG-powered agents for different security functions, so that complex security operations can be handled by domain-specific expertise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN coordinating security operations THEN the system SHALL orchestrate 6 specialized agents: Threat Hunter, Intelligence Analyst, Incident Commander, Forensics Investigator, Compliance Advisor, and Communication Specialist
2. WHEN agents collaborate THEN they SHALL share context and findings through a centralized coordination mechanism
3. WHEN generating outputs THEN each agent SHALL provide domain-specific insights enhanced by relevant retrieved knowledge
4. IF agent coordination conflicts arise THEN the system SHALL resolve them using predefined priority rules and escalation procedures
